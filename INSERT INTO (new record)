-- Note the BusinessEntityID that is returned from this query. This 
-- number is the BusinessEntityID that you will need in the next step:

 

-- 1. Create an INSERT statement to add a new row to the Person.Person
-- table in the AdventureWorks2017 database. Insert your own name 
-- and information into the database. Make up any other information that
-- is needed for adding a new person to this table. (It is helpful to
-- run an SELECT statement to see what the current data looks like in
-- the table.) If a column accepts NULL then feel free to add NULL 
-- in your new row for some of these columns. (For a “guid” field you can
-- use the “NEWID()” function to generate the value for this column.
-- For the current date and time you can use the “GETDATE()” function 
-- to generate the value for this column.) For the BusineesEntityID you
-- need to use the BusinessEntityID that was returned from the first
-- step where you inserted a new record into the Person.BusinessEntity
-- (local table.
